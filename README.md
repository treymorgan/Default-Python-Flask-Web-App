Certainly! Here's a sample `README.md` file for your Python web application:

---

# Default Python Web Application
# Author: Trey Morgan
# Purpose: This is the default template that I wrote to setup basic functionality for my python websites.

## Introduction

This is a simple Python web application built using the Flask framework. It includes basic functionality for user registration, login, and logout, all backed by a SQLite database. The application is styled using CSS and is designed to be easy to deploy and run, either locally or within a Docker container.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create an account by providing their first name, last name, email, username, and password.
- **User Login/Logout**: Registered users can log in and log out securely.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is styled with responsive CSS, ensuring it looks good on various devices.

## File Overview

### 1. `main.py`
This is the main application file. It defines the Flask app and sets up routes for registration, login, logout, and the homepage. The application also handles database interactions and user authentication.

### 2. `base.html`
This is the base HTML template that contains the overall structure of the webpage, including the navigation menu, content blocks, and footer. Other HTML files extend this template.

### 3. `login.html`
This HTML template extends `base.html` and provides the layout for the login page. Users can enter their username and password here to log in.

### 4. `register.html`
This HTML template extends `base.html` and provides the layout for the registration page. Users can enter their details here to create a new account.

### 5. `styles.css`
This CSS file contains the base styling for the entire application, including body styles, navigation menu styles, and footer styles.

### 6. `login-styles.css`
This CSS file contains specific styles for the login and registration pages, such as form layout and input field styling.

### 7. `.gitignore`
This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git. Typically, this includes files like `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, environment variables, and the SQLite database file.

### 8. `config.py`
This file contains configuration settings for the Flask application, including the `SECRET_KEY` for sessions and `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` for the database connection.

### 9. `Dockerfile`
This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image for the application. It installs all the necessary dependencies and sets up the environment to run the Flask app within a Docker container.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-Login
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Werkzeug
- Waitress
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    The database will be automatically created when you first run the application.

5. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

6. **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5003` to see the application in action.

### Docker Setup

1. **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t flask-app .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5003:5003 flask-app
    ```

3. **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5003` to see the application running inside the Docker container.

### Environment Configuration

The `config.py` file is used to manage sensitive information like the `SECRET_KEY` and `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`. Ensure this file is properly configured before deploying the application.

### Deployment Considerations

- **Security**: Make sure to keep your `SECRET_KEY` secure and never expose it in your version control.
- **Database**: The application uses SQLite by default, which is suitable for development and small-scale deployment. For production, consider switching to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Scaling**: If you need to scale this application, consider deploying it on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, and using a managed database service.
